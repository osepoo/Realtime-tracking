## Description
- This repository contains two Android apps: DriverApp and PassengerApp. The DriverApp allows drivers to share their location in real-time, while the PassengerApp allows passengers to track the location of the driver they are connected with.

- Both apps are built with Android Studio and use Firebase Realtime Database for real-time data synchronization.
## How to use
- In the 'google_api.xml' of each app, replace the string with your own generated api key.
